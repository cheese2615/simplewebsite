            <h2>Accountability</h2>
            
                <p>1. I define accountability as taking ownership of my actions and following through on what I commit to.
                <p>2. I learned this value through leadership roles, team projects, and situations where people depended on me to deliver.
                <p>3. Accountability is important because it builds credibility and shows others they can rely on me.
                <p>4. When I fail to be accountable, I damage trust, weaken team performance, and limit my own growth.

            <h2>Collaboration</h2>
            
               <p>1. I define collaboration as working with others in a way that values shared ideas, active listening, and collective success.
                <p>2. I developed this value through group projects, student leadership, and experiences where teamwork produced better outcomes than individual effort.
                <p>3. Collaboration is important because it brings diverse strengths together and creates solutions that no one person could achieve alone.
                <p>4. When I fail to collaborate, I contribute to miscommunication, duplicated work, and a breakdown in team trust.

            <h2>Integrity</h2>
            
                <p>1. I see integrity as acting honestly and consistently with my values, even when it is difficult.
                <p>2. I developed this value through academic expectations, leadership responsibilities, and moments where doing the right thing required courage.
                <p>3. Integrity is important because it shapes my reputation and determines whether people feel they can trust me.
                <p>4. When I do not uphold integrity, I risk losing credibility, damaging relationships, and creating long-term consequences that are hard to repair.
            </p>

            <h2>Empathy</h2>
            
                <p>1. I define empathy as my ability to understand what others are feeling and respond with genuine care.
                <p>2. I developed this value through peer mentoring, group work, and moments where listening mattered more than speaking.
                <p>3. Empathy is important to me because it helps build trust and makes people feel safe sharing their experiences.
                <p>4. When I fail to practice empathy, I risk misreading situations, damaging relationships, and making others feel unseen or dismissed.
