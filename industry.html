            <h2>Ethical Issue in Fleet Management</h2>
            <p>
                Many fleets push aggressive schedules that encourage long hours, skipped breaks, or violations of hours of service rules. Fatigue increases crash risk and harms driver’s health.

            <h2>My Personal Values in Response to Ethical Issue
            </h2>
            <p>My values of empathy, accountability, and collaboration shape how I respond to fair labor issues.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I would naturally focus on how unfair schedules and unsafe conditions are, and I would try to understand their experiences before forming conclusions.</li>
                <li>I would emphasize the importance of honoring commitments, maintaining safe practices, and taking responsibility for the impact of decisions on the people who keep operations running.</li>
                <li>I would look for solutions that involve everyone because the best outcomes come from shared ideas and collective effort.</li>
                          </ul>
              <p>Together, these values would lead me to approach fair labor concerns with care, integrity, and a desire to build systems where everyone can succeed.</p>
